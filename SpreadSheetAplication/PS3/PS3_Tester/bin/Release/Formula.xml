            Represents formulas written in standard infix notation using standard precedence
            rules.  The allowed symbols are non-negative numbers written using floating-point
            syntax, variables that consist of one or more letters followed by one or more 
            digits, parentheses, and the four operator symbols +, -, *, and /.

            CONSTRUCTOR - Creates a Formula from a string that consists of an infix expression written as
            described in the class comment.  If the expression is syntacticaly invalid,
            throws a FormulaFormatException with an explanatory Message.

            <summary>
            Evaluates this Formula, using the lookup delegate to determine the values of
            variables.  
            
            Given a variable symbol as its parameter, lookup returns the
            variable's value (if it has one) or throws an ArgumentException (otherwise).
            
            If no undefined variables or divisions by zero are encountered when evaluating 
            this Formula, the value is returned.  Otherwise, a FormulaError is returned.  
            The Reason property of the FormulaError should have a meaningful explanation.

            <summary>
            Enumerates all of the variables that occur in this formula.  No variable
            may appear more than once in the enumeration, even if it appears more than
            once in this Formula.

        <member name="M:SpreadsheetUtilities.Formula.ToString">
            <summary>
            Returns a string containing no spaces which, if passed to the Formula
            constructor, will produce a Formula f such that this.Equals(f).

            If obj is null or obj is not a Formula, returns false.  Otherwise, reports
            whether or not this Formula and obj are equal.
            
            Two Formulae are considered equal if they consist of the same tokens in the
            same order.  All tokens are compared as strings except for numeric tokens,
            which are compared as doubles.
            
            Here are some examples.  
            new Formula("x1+y2").Equals(new Formula("x1  +  y2")) is true
            new Formula("x1+y2").Equalas(new Formula("y2+x1")) is false

            <summary>
            Reports whether f1 == f2, using the notion of equality from the Equals method.
            Note that if both f1 and f2 are null, this method should return true.  If one is
            null and one is not, this method should return false.

            Reports whether f1 != f2, using the notion of equality from the Equals method.
            Note that if both f1 and f2 are null, this method should return false.  If one is
            null and one is not, this method should return true.

            <summary>
            Given a formula, enumerates the tokens that compose it.  Tokens are left paren,
            right paren, one of the four operator symbols, a string consisting of one or more
            letters followed by one or more digits, a double literal, and anything that doesn't
